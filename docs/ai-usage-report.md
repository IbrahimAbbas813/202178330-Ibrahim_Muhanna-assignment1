## A) Tools Used & Use Cases

### ChatGPT
I used ChatGPT as a development assistant throughout this project. Specifically, it helped with:

- Generating the initial HTML structure (header, sections, footer).
- Suggesting CSS layout using Flexbox and Grid.
- Implementing JavaScript features such as:
  - Dark/Light theme toggle
  - Contact form validation
- Improving wording for the About Me section.
- Structuring the README and documentation files.

All generated code was reviewed and adjusted before being finalized.

## B) Benefits & Challenges

### Benefits

- Faster project scaffolding and structure setup.
- Clear explanations of responsive design concepts.
- Assistance with debugging layout and formatting issues.
- Helped organize documentation professionally.

### Challenges

- Some generated code required cleanup and simplification.
- Minor formatting issues occurred in Markdown and needed correction.
- I had to carefully review logic to ensure full understanding.
- File path issues required manual correction.

AI accelerated development, but manual review and testing were necessary to ensure correctness.

## C) Learning Outcomes

Through using AI in this assignment, I learned:

- How to structure semantic HTML properly.
- How to use Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout.
- How to implement media queries for responsive design.
- How JavaScript event listeners work.
- How `event.preventDefault()` controls form behavior.
- How to use `localStorage` to save user preferences.
- The importance of reviewing and testing AI-generated code.

Using AI improved both my workflow and understanding of front-end development concepts.

## D) Responsible Use & Modifications

AI was used responsibly as a support tool, not as a replacement for my work.

To ensure academic integrity:

- I reviewed every code snippet carefully.
- I renamed variables and adjusted formatting.
- I removed unnecessary or redundant code.
- I tested responsiveness using browser developer tools.
- I ensured I understood each JavaScript feature implemented.
- I modified structure and styling to match my personal design.

All final code reflects my understanding and modifications.

## Reflection

AI tools improved productivity and helped clarify technical concepts. However, the final implementation required my own review, testing, and refinement to ensure quality and correctness.
