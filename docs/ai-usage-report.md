Assignment: Assignment 1 – Foundation & AI Integration

A) Tools Used & Use Cases
1. ChatGPT

I used ChatGPT to:

Generate the initial HTML structure for my portfolio (header, sections, footer).

Suggest clean and organized CSS layout using Flexbox and Grid.

Help implement JavaScript features such as:

Dark/Light theme toggle

Contact form validation and interaction

Improve wording for the About Me section and project descriptions.

Provide explanations for technical documentation.

I did not copy code blindly. I used AI suggestions as a starting point and then reviewed and modified them to fit my project requirements.

B) Benefits & Challenges
Benefits

Helped me scaffold the project structure quickly.

Provided guidance on responsive design and breakpoints.

Assisted in understanding JavaScript event handling.

Improved code readability and organization.

Saved time when implementing theme toggle logic and validation.

Challenges

Some AI-generated code required cleanup and simplification.

I needed to adjust styles to match my design preferences.

I had to debug small issues related to file paths and layout alignment.

Understanding how certain JavaScript parts worked required additional review.

AI helped accelerate development, but I still needed to understand and refine the output.

C) Learning Outcomes

Through using AI in this assignment, I learned:

How to structure a semantic HTML document properly.

How to use Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive layouts.

How to implement media queries for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

How JavaScript event listeners work (especially addEventListener).

How to prevent default form behavior using event.preventDefault().

How to use localStorage to store theme preferences.

The importance of reviewing and testing AI-generated code before using it.

This process improved both my technical skills and my development workflow.

D) Responsible Use & Modifications

I used AI as a development assistant, not as a replacement for my work.

To ensure academic integrity:

I reviewed every generated code snippet carefully.

I modified structure, variable names, and formatting to match my project.

I removed unnecessary code suggested by AI.

I tested responsiveness manually using browser developer tools.

I ensured I understood how each JavaScript function worked.

I adjusted styling to reflect my own design decisions.

All final code reflects my understanding and personal modifications.

Reflection

Using AI responsibly improved my productivity while maintaining full control over the project. I ensured transparency by documenting how AI was used and by understanding every implemented feature.
